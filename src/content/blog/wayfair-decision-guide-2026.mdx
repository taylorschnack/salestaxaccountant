## What Changed After Wayfair?

The 2018 *South Dakota v. Wayfair* Supreme Court decision fundamentally transformed sales tax compliance for online sellers and remote businesses. Here's what you need to know in 2026.

### Economic Nexus Explained

**Economic nexus** means you can owe sales tax in a state even without physical presence. States can now require remote sellers to collect tax based on:

- **Sales revenue** into the state
- **Number of transactions** into the state
- Or a combination of both

### Current State Thresholds (2026)

Most states have adopted one of these thresholds:

- **$100,000 in sales** OR **200 transactions** per year
- **$500,000 in sales** (no transaction count)
- Varies by state—always verify current rules

## When Do You Need to Register?

You must register for a sales tax permit when you exceed a state's economic nexus threshold. Key considerations:

### 1. Monitor Your Sales by State

Track your revenue and transaction count monthly. Use your:
- E-commerce platform reports
- Accounting software
- Tax automation tools (Avalara, TaxJar, Vertex)

### 2. Understand Lookback Periods

States use different measurement periods:
- **Current or prior calendar year** (most common)
- **Trailing 12 months**
- **Current calendar year only**

### 3. Registration Timeline

Once you exceed thresholds:
- Register **before** your next sale in that state
- Some states allow grace periods (typically 30 days)
- Penalties for late registration can be severe

## Marketplace Facilitator Rules

If you sell on Amazon, eBay, Etsy, or other marketplaces, **they** may collect tax on your behalf. However:

- You're still responsible for direct sales
- Some states exclude marketplace sales from your nexus calculation
- Always verify what the marketplace is collecting

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Ignoring Small States

Even if you only made $105,000 in Wyoming, you still have nexus. Don't skip states just because they're small.

### 2. Using Incorrect Tax Rates

- **Destination-based** states (most): Tax based on buyer's location
- **Origin-based** states (rare): Tax based on your location
- Know which applies to each state

### 3. Missing Local Taxes

Many states have city, county, and district taxes on top of state rates. Always use current, complete rate tables.

## Compliance Best Practices

### Build a Nexus Monitoring System

1. **Monthly review** of sales by state
2. **Quarterly assessment** of new nexus obligations
3. **Annual audit** of all registrations and filings

### Use Technology Wisely

Consider automation for:
- Tax rate lookups
- Tax calculation
- Return filing
- Exemption certificate management

### Document Everything

Maintain records of:
- When you established nexus
- Registration dates and permit numbers
- Exemption certificates
- Audit correspondence

## Voluntary Disclosure Agreements (VDAs)

If you discover past nexus, consider a VDA:

**Benefits:**
- Reduced lookback period (often 3-4 years vs. statute of limitations)
- Penalty waivers
- Anonymous application process in many states

**Process:**
1. Identify past exposure
2. Work with a sales tax professional
3. Apply through state VDA program
4. Negotiate terms
5. Register and pay agreed amount

## Next Steps for Your Business

### Immediate Actions

1. **Conduct a nexus study** across all states where you have customers
2. **Register** where you currently have nexus
3. **Set up systems** to monitor ongoing compliance

### Ongoing Compliance

- Review nexus monthly
- File returns on time
- Keep exemption certificates organized
- Stay updated on state law changes
