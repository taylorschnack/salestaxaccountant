## You Received an Audit Notice—Now What?

A sales tax audit notification can be stressful, but with proper preparation, most businesses can navigate the process successfully.

### Types of Sales Tax Audits

**Desk Audit:**
- Conducted remotely
- Review of filed returns
- Documentation submitted electronically
- Generally shorter duration

**Field Audit:**
- Auditor visits your location
- In-person review of records
- More comprehensive
- Can last weeks or months

**Industry-Wide Audit:**
- Targets specific sectors
- Often focused on common issues
- May involve multiple years
- Example: E-commerce nexus compliance

## What Triggers an Audit?

States select audit candidates based on:

### Red Flags

1. **Never filed** but significant economic activity detected
2. **Zero or low tax liability** in high-audit states
3. **Significant decrease** in reported sales
4. **Exemption certificate abuse** patterns
5. **Late filings or payments**
6. **Round numbers** suggesting estimates rather than actual data
7. **Industry targeting** (especially e-commerce, SaaS)

### Random Selection

Some audits are purely random, especially in states with regular audit cycles.

## The Audit Process Timeline

## Common Audit Issues

### 1. Exemption Certificates

**What auditors look for:**

- Expired certificates
- Invalid exemption reasons
- Certificates from wrong states

**How to prepare:**
- Run exemption certificate audit
- Re-collect missing/invalid certificates
- Document good faith efforts
- Organize by customer alphabetically

**Pro tip:** Many states offer amnesty for certificates collected during audit period.

### 2. Nexus Issues

**What auditors check:**
- Physical presence (offices, employees, inventory)
- Economic nexus thresholds
- Marketplace seller relationships
- Affiliate nexus
- Trade show or event participation

**How to prepare:**
- Document all locations and personnel by period

### 3. Product/Service Taxability

**What auditors question:**
- Incorrect exempt treatment
- Bundling issues (taxable + exempt items)
- Drop shipment handling
- Digital goods classification

**How to prepare:**
- Create detailed product/service catalog
- Document taxability research
- Identify gray areas proactively
- Obtain advance rulings if possible

### 4. Use Tax

**What auditors assess:**
- Purchases from out-of-state vendors
- Untaxed purchases subject to use tax
- Capital asset acquisitions
- Services purchased

**How to prepare:**
- Review accounts payable for untaxed purchases
- Self-assess use tax owed
- Separate truly exempt purchases
- Document exemptions (resale, manufacturing, etc.)

## Sampling in Sales Tax Audits

### How Sampling Works

Auditors often can't review every transaction, so they use **statistical sampling**:

1. **Define population** (e.g., all sales in audit period)
2. **Select sample** (usually 50-300 transactions)
3. **Audit sample** in detail
4. **Project results** across entire population

### Why Sampling Matters

A small error rate in your sample can equal massive liability when projected.

**Example:**
- Sample shows 5% error rate
- Total sales over 3 years: $10 million
- Projected tax liability: $30,000+ (at 6% tax rate)

### Challenge Bad Samples

You can contest sampling methodology:
- Sample not representative
- Small sample size
- Errors in projection calculation
- Known population characteristics ignored

## Managing the Audit

### Do's

✅ **Be cooperative but cautious**
- Answer questions honestly
- Provide requested documents
- Don't volunteer extra information

✅ **Stay organized**
- Track all communications
- Document every conversation
- Keep timeline of audit activities

✅ **Control the process**
- Designate single point of contact
- Schedule meetings in advance
- Limit auditor access to only necessary areas

✅ **Fix errors proactively**
- If you find an error, report it
- Shows good faith
- May limit penalties

### Don'ts

❌ **Don't ignore the auditor**
- Response delays = extended audit
- May result in harsher treatment

❌ **Don't make statements you can't support**
- Everything is documented
- Inconsistencies raise red flags

❌ **Don't provide unorganized data dumps**
- Makes audit longer
- May expose unrelated issues

❌ **Don't miss deadlines**
- Audit stays open longer
- Limits negotiation leverage

## Negotiating the Assessment

### Review the Findings Carefully

**Check for:**
- Math errors
- Misclassified transactions
- Incorrect tax rates
- Double-counted items
- Transactions outside audit period

### Build Your Case

**Gather evidence for:**
- Valid exemption certificates (even if not previously provided)
- Documentation of exempt sales
- Proof of tax paid (to another jurisdiction)
- Statute of limitations issues

### Negotiation Strategies

**Leverage points:**
- **Volume discount** - States may reduce amount for quick settlement
- **Abatement programs** - First-time penalty abatement
- **Economic hardship** - Payment plans or offer-in-compromise
- **Agree to forward compliance** - Register in exchange for reduced lookback

**Common outcomes:**
- Full tax owed (no penalties if good faith)
- Reduced penalty (from 25% to 10% or eliminated)
- Limited lookback period
- Payment plan (6-36 months typical)

## After the Audit

### Implement Changes

Use audit findings to improve:
- Tax determination processes
- Exemption certificate management
- Use tax accruals
- Nexus monitoring

### Forward Compliance

Auditors often require:
- Registration if not already registered
- Improved documentation procedures
- Regular filings going forward
- Follow-up audits in some cases

### Appeals Process

If you disagree with final assessment:

**Informal protest** (30-60 days typically)
- Submit to audit supervisor
- Present additional evidence
- Negotiate before formal assessment

**Formal appeal** (60-90 days typically)
- File with state board of appeals
- More formal process
- May require hearing
- Can go to court if unsuccessful

## When to Hire Professional Help

Consider professional assistance if:

- **Large exposure** (over $50,000)
- **Complex issues** (multi-state, SaaS taxability, manufacturing)
- **Criminal investigation** concerns
- **No internal expertise**
- **Contentious relationship** with auditor

**What professionals provide:**
- Audit representation
- Document preparation
- Sampling analysis
- Negotiation expertise
- Appeal support

## Preventing Future Audits

### Best Practices

1. **File and pay on time** - Always
2. **Keep pristine records** - 4-7 years minimum
3. **Manage exemption certificates** - Collect, validate, store
4. **Document positions** - Taxability memos, nexus studies
5. **Self-audit regularly** - Find issues before auditors do
6. **Stay current** - Monitor law changes

### Red Flag Reduction

Avoid audit triggers:
- Consistent filing patterns
- Reasonable tax liability ratios
- Complete and accurate exemption documentation
